# Revolutio
Shows Bicycle Gear Ratios information

Revolutio is Latin for Cycling.

This App will help you understand your gear ratios and how far one revolution of your pedals will take you.

When you open the app it will try and start with the information you last added to it. If not it will start with default information.

On the top Left we have the tyre size on the rear of the bike. Drop down the menu to choose your correct tyre size. There may be small differences with your tyre depending on the pressure of the tyre but these will be very small. Changing settings here will result in the Data on how far you travel changing in real time.

To the right of the Tyre size is where you put in your front Gears. If you have just one ring of gears here, then untick the box. If you have more than one gear ring then you put in the smallest and the largest. 

To the right of that we find the rear Cassette and again we add just the smallest and largest gear size.

On the righhand side is the buttons that open this help file, close the app and the largest will redraw the data. Use this if you change any gear sizes so it all gets redrawn.

The main section shows a tabbed grid view of the data. The first tab shows the gear ratios.

The second how far you will travel in metres when using the specified ratio.

The 3rd tab will allow you to select the exact size gears that you want to look at. This will summarise the results to just what is on your bike. If you untick the box, then when you go back to the previous 2 tabs you will find the data has vanished.
